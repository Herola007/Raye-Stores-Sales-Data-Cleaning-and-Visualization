### Project Overview
As a junior data analyst, I had the opportunity to work with Raye Stores to clean and restructure a poorly organized dataset provided by their sales department. The project's objective was clear: to transform the messy data into a well-structured format that could be used for effective analysis and reporting.

Upon receiving the dataset from the sales team, I immediately began the cleaning process. Using Power Query, I followed a methodical approach to ensure the data was accurate, and consistent, while also establishing a fixed schema for future analysis.

This repository provides a step-by-step walkthrough of the entire data cleaning process, showcasing how Power Query was utilized to handle various data issues. The final cleaned dataset was then prepared for further analysis and visualization in Power BI to extract actionable insights.


### Data Cleaning/Transformation
The dataset provided by the sales team came in a CSV format, which I initially opened using Microsoft Excel. To perform the necessary transformations, I imported the entire dataset into Power Query Editor, where I could take full control of the cleaning and transformation process. Although the dataset initially appeared chaotic, once imported, it became much more manageable within Power Query.

This section will detail the step-by-step process of how the data was transformed and cleaned. Screenshots will be provided throughout to visually illustrate each step, along with explanations of what actions were performed and why. At the end of this write-up, I will also include a screenshot of the applied steps in Power Query, summarizing the entire transformation process.
