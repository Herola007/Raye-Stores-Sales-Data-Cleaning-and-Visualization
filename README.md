### Project Overview
I was opportuned to work for Raye Stores' as a junior data analyst in cleaning a badly structured dataset provided by their sales department. This objective of the project was quite clear to me so immediately after getting the dataset from their sales team I jumped into it. I will be showing a step by step process of how this data was cleaned and ensuring it had a fixed schema with Power Query.
